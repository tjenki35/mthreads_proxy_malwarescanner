## This multi-threaded server offers the following functionality:
1. Can handle multiple requests concurrently.
2. Multi-process port mapping for proxy. (It is possible to map multiple server instances to multiple ports
from the same server console). 
3. Anti-malware scanning utilizing the Team Cymru public facing malware scanning service using SHA-1. 
4. Code is portable to many different platforms taking advantage of Java's JVM model. 


## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
