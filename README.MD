## This multi-threaded server offers the following functionality:
1. Can handle multiple requests concurrently.
2. Multi-thread port mapping for proxy. (It is possible to map multiple server instances to multiple ports
from the same server console). 
3. Anti-malware scanning utilizing the Team Cymru public facing malware scanning service using SHA-1. 
4. Code is portable to many different platforms taking advantage of Java's JVM model. 
**note: This proxy only supports HTTP/1.0 requests for now (as well as only GET requests)

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

### **To build this project:**
` make `

### **To run this project**
` make run `

(this will invoke a single proxy port mapping on the default port 4545)

### **OR to run the process on a custom initialized port**
` java proxy.PConsole [port] `

Where [port] indicicates the port on the local host where you would like the service to run. 

## OPERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

After the process has been setup and run the process will bring the user to a "Server Console"
**Indicated as**
$

### While in the Server Console the following commands are available: </br>

#### 1. Terminates the server after processing all remaining requests
` q `

#### 2. Begins listening for requests on the specified port
` add {port} `

#### 3. Tears down the listener at the specified port
` remove {port} `

#### 4. Sets server verbosity level*
` verbose {0,1,2} `

#### 5. Toggles Team Cymru MHR scanning of HTML objects*
` cymru {on|off} `
